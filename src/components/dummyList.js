import React from 'react'

const dummyList = () => {
  return (
    <div>
    <p style={{textAlign: 'center', marginTop: '10rem', color: '#044599', padding: '0 10%'}}>
      Here should have been a list. Unfortunately there is none. But since
      this text gets rendered I consider this mission completed
    </p>
  </div>
  )
}

export default dummyList
